Tweeting Plants at HackMIT

This is a project by Ricky Mutschlechner (ricky54326), Nick Heindl (katamaritaco) and Mitchell Lutzke (melutzke). We are connecting sensors to a plant, Horton, which will allow him to communicate to the world via Twitter (@HortonThePlant)! This code is mainly written in Java, using the JTwitter Library as well as Signpost for OAuth, and Apache Commons Codec. This is a work in progress and will be worked on even after the Hackathon is over.
