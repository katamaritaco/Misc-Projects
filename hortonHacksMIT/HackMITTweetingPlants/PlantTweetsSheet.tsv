Can't explain that. #weatherData @wunderground	It's a beautiful mornin'  AHHHHH http://goo.gl/ioY7OA			
WeatherBad	Rain, rain go away. Come again another day. #drowning	Looking bad outside. Hope I don't see any cows flying around. #twister #tornado	Looking like rain, or hail, or something. Whatever comes this way, it better not mess, or I'll round up my plant homies.	Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening me #FreddysMyMan	I sense a storm a brewin' #plantsenses #tingling	Something seems wrong outside. Probably the PSA tapping into our roots. #PlantSecurityAgency	I knew she was nearby: http://goo.gl/flXyIF #XMen #Storm			
TemperatureGood	It's getting hot in here, so take off all your leaves. @nelly_mo	I might not be in Florida, but this temperature is fine with me #OnVacation	Mmmm.... toasty #NotTalkingAboutQuiznos	Fahrenheit 451 - The temperature at which plants cease to exist.	This heat reminds me of home. #Africa #Aloe	Diggin' this heat. #subsaharan #plant #ftw!	This has to be the warmest Hockey Rink I"ve ever been to. @HackMIT			
TemperatureBad	Cooooold.... aaaaas iiiiiiiice, I'm as cold as ice.	It's feeling a bit chilly in here, bro-skis.	Any colder, and they'll be unthawing me 1000 years later as the most bad-ass ice-ma... ice-plant alive.	My monocot leaves are freezing :(. Heat plz.	What do they think I am? A deciduous tree? #TurnTheHeatUp	Wish I had some hair to keep me warm. #Aloe #suckstobebald				
HumidityGood	It's like a Finnish sauna in here #humidity #offdachartz	The air is kinda wet, almost too wet... #wut	Air's so moist I could swim through it.	So humid, I think I'm going to grow gills. #fish #plant #hybrid	Too. much. humidity. Can't. Transpire. Properly. #transpiration #someone #halp	Feels like I'm in a jungle over here. #humidashell #stickierthansap	So... Humid...	Why the hell doesn't somebody get me a dehumidifer already #drowningInAir		
HumidityBad	It hasn't been this dry outside since my cameo in @BreakingBad_AMC	I'm so dry. No, not of alcohol, I'm always covered on that front.	Losing moisture pretty fast, it'd be cool-beans if someone could take care of this. Or not... whatever, not like I depend on you or anything... ass.	Almost as dry as a smokehouse over here. Can you even smoke plants? #immolationisscary	All this dry weather is giving me sappy leaves. #bloodynosesareforhumans #plantsbleedsap	@MotherNature not even mad. #dryheat				
TiltBad	Tiltin' like a mofo #toomuchswag #leanlikeacholo	Help I've fallen, and I can't get up :[ #TooYoungForLifeAlert	Seriously, can somebody prop my leaves up? #fallingover	So this is what a rollercoaster feels like. #plantwhiplash #nomegusta	My leaves keep drooping. I can't feel my stem. No #affordablecareact for plants :/	Why am I swaying so much? #moreSwayThanMTV				
MoistureGood	Feeling really moist right now... #didIReallyJustSayThat #notOnlyCakeIsMoist	So water.... Such H2O #doge	So wet I may as well be #OnABoat	They say that water is essential for life. I must be living the life...	Swimmin' in happiness. #Moisture #feelsgoodman	All this water makes my roots tingle. #ujelly				
MoistureBad	Waaatttteeeerr. http://youtu.be/HA1mbZ_MMh8 #parched	I'm drying up, man. This might be the end. If I die, I blame Nick Heindl! http://i.imgur.com/d2aoYcY.jpg	My soil is more dry than the Sahara. Anybody want to help a plant out? #thirsty #dying	More dry than a beached whale. Please. Water. #Dyingoverhere	Being deprived of water is not fun. #isthiswhatnofoodfeelslike	So thirsty. @SwampyTheGator Where's my water?!	I haven't been this dry since I was trapped in that towel factory.	I'm all dried up :/ #BlueStamens	How do I perform a rain dance? I need some fluids.	PLANT NEEDS WATER BADLY
LightGood	You are my sunshine, my only sunshine!	Here comes the sun! #doodadoodoo @thebeatles	Sun, sun, sun, here it comes! @thebeatles	Hey now, plants need vitamin D too. #Sun #feelsgoodman	Screw the two scoops, I'll just take that Sun. http://goo.gl/qaMfqT #datSun #betterThanRaisins 	Sun = Energy + Tingles. #DatPhotosynthesis	So much Sun, but I can't get burnt. #plant #aloe #superpower	Soakin' up all the UV. #Radiation #Delicious		
LightBad	Darkness, imprisoning me. All that I see, absolute horror. #one @metallica	Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen... Sure is dark in here.	It's darker in here than my outlook on life #zing	It might be dark, but I can still see you. Nobody try nothing strange. #BigBrother	Light levels are low but I'm #AlwaysWatching like #BigBrother	Why aren't grow lights covered under #AFC ? I need it to live! #thanksObama	TURN ON THE LIGHT	Can't see anything! It's so dark!		
SoundGood	Nice and quiet near me. Nobody better mess w/ this #thuglife	So quiet here you could almost hear me whistle.	Droppin' pins and listening to 'em #quiet	Quiet enough to hear myself think... Nice.	Maybe it's a bit too quiet, I could go for some classical music. Maybe even some smooth jazz.	 It's quiet... too quiet.	It's so quiet over here, somebody talk to me please. #lonely #plantfeels	Playing music to plants does NOT make them grow faster. It annoys the fertilizer out of them.		
SoundBad	If it gets any louder than this, I'm going to have to unroot myself and take care of this shit myself.	WHO'S THERE? YOU'RE SO LOUD!	LOUD NOISES http://i.imgur.com/EWFzV.gif	SHUT UP BROS #loud	Attention Hipsters: You are all loud as hell. That is all #stfu #tryingToPhotoSynthesize #needPeace	Jammin out to this. Reminds me of my childhood. http://goo.gl/tDumR1 @TheRoots #seed	All I hear is wub. This pleases Horton.	So much noise right now. Is somebody actually jamming @taproot		
MiscGood	The Fox by Ylvis is stuck in my head. Metaphorically, anyhow... #WhatDoesThePlantSay	Are you a horticulture major? Because I have a large apical meristem that needs examining. #whatamIdoingwithmylife	Just absorbed some DAMN FINE nitrogen.	Sun tan lotion is murder. #Aloe	COMMENCE THE JIGGLIN' #JiggleBilly #PlantsLove #ATHF	I don't see the problem. Bloom is great to me... http://goo.gl/gWK1yF #NoJaggiesThere	If a human dies in a city, does anybody feel it? #plantphilosophy #Sucrates	Check out my honey: http://goo.gl/vUu5iw #TagABeautifulGirl	Horton - Horticulture. MY LIFE FINALLY HAS MEANING! #enlightened	Am I not the coolest plant you've ever talked to? Find out how I'm doing 920-351-4761
MiscBad	When you die I'll eat you. #ItsOkImAPlant	If a plant picks up nutrients from a dead plant, is it a cannibal? #suchwonder	Still haven't recovered from my flight here :(	Snape kills Dumbledore. #BeHappyIDidntTalkAboutBreakingBad	Damnit Marie! They're minerals!	How did my ancestors deal with this? http://goo.gl/3Imm6w	Hacking doesn't mean the same to plants as it does to humans. #lumberjacks #scaryashell	"Urgent! Water me!" Is that seriously all you do? @pothos #theresANewSheriffInTown	Still not sure if bees rubbing their butts on me is a good thing... #pollinate	Plant Carnivores = Human Vegetarians. #roleReversal
