WeatherBad	Rain, rain go away. Come again another day. #drowning	Looking bad outside. Hope I don't see any cows flying around. #twister #tornado	Looking like rain, or hail, or something. Whatever comes this way, it better not mess, or I'll round up my plant homies.	Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening me #FreddysMyMan	
TemperatureGood	It's getting hot in here, so take off all your leaves. @nelly_mo	I might not be in Florida, but this temperature is fine with me #OnVacation	Mmmm.... toasty #NotTalkingAboutQuiznos	Fahrenheit 451 - The temperature at which plants cease to exist.	
TemperatureNeutral					
TemperatureBad	Cooooold.... aaaaas iiiiiiiice, I'm as cold as ice.	It's feeling a bit chilly in here, bro-skis.	Any colder, and they'll be unthawing me 1000 years later as the most bad-ass ice-ma... ice-plant alive.	My monocot leaves are freezing :(. Heat plz.	
HumidityGood	It's like a Finnish sauna in here #humidity #offdachartz	The air is kinda wet, almost too wet... #wut	Air's so moist I could swim through it.		
HumidityBad	It hasn't been this dry outside since my cameo in @BreakingBad_AMC	I'm so dry. No, not of alcohol, I'm always covered on that front.	Losing moisture pretty fast, it'd be cool-beans if someone could take care of this. Or not... whatever, not like I depend on you or anthing... ass.

LightGood	You are my sunshine, my only sunshine!	Here comes the sun! #doodadoodoo @thebeatles	Sun, sun, sun, here it comes! @thebeatles		
LightBad	Darkness, imprisoning me. All that I see, absolute horror. #one @metallica	Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen... Sure is dark in here.	It's darker in here than my outlook on life #zing	It might be dark, but I can still see you. Nobody try nothing strange. #BigBrother	Light levels are low but I'm #AlwaysWatching like #BigBrother
SoundGood	Nice and quiet near me. Nobody better mess w/ this #thuglife	So quiet here you could almost hear me whistle.	Droppin' pins and listening to 'em #quiet	Quiet enough to hear myself think... Nice.	Maybe it's a bit too quiet, I could go for some classical music. Maybe even some smooth jazz.
SoundBad	If it gets any louder than this, I'm going to have to unroot myself and take care of this shit myself.	WHO'S THERE? YOU'RE SO LOUD!	LOUND NOISES http://i.imgur.com/EWFzV.gif	SHUT UP NOOBS #loud	
MiscGood	The Fox by Ylvis is stuck in my head. Metaphorically, anyhow... #WhatDoesThePlantSay	Are you a horticulture major? Because I have a large apical meristem that needs examining. #whatamIdoingwithmylife	Just absorbed some DAMN FINE nitrogen.	Plants need energy drinks too. #MountainDewLiterally	COMMENCE THE JIGGLIN
MiscBad	When you die I'll eat you. #ItsOkImaPlant	If a plant picks up nutrients from a died plant, is it a cannibal? #suchwonder	Still haven't recovered from my flight here :(	Snape kills Dumbledore. #BeHappyIDidntTalkAboutBreakingBad
